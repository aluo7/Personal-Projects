## Introduction

Stock markets are intricate systems influenced by a plethora of factors both internal (like company performance, dividends) and external (like geopolitical events, economic indicators). Predicting stock prices is not just about finding patterns in historical data but understanding these myriad of influences. Using RNNs, which are particularly suited for sequence prediction problems, we try to capture these patterns and influences to predict the next day's closing stock price.

## Background on RNNs

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a unique subset of neural networks tailored for recognizing patterns within sequential data, such as time series or text. A distinguishing characteristic of RNNs is their "memory." Contrary to traditional feed-forward neural networks, RNNs possess the ability to retain information, allowing past data to influence subsequent predictions. This attribute renders them particularly effective for tasks where historical information plays a pivotal role in present predictions.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Leveraged the `yfinance` library to obtain historical stock data of target companies.
2. **Preprocessing**: Transformed the data into a time-lagged dataset using the past 30 days' closing prices to project the next day's closing price.
3. **Modeling**: Composed an RNN model using TensorFlow, comprising multiple layers tailored for the task at hand.
4. **Evaluation**: Post training, the model was employed to predict the next day's closing price based on the latest 30 days of closing prices.

## Results

The model was trained on historical stock data from '2020-01-01' to '2023-07-30'. Using this model, we predicted the next day's closing price for a specific date.

**Model Accuracy**: Predicting stock prices is notoriously difficult. Financial professionals spend significant resources on this challenge, and even then, no model is foolproof. For demonstration purposes, we predicted the next day's closing price for Apple Inc. (AAPL). The model achieved a MAE of about $3-$8, which is underachieving, but overall a good result for a simple demonstration.

## Considerations and Limitations

While the RNN approach is intriguing, it's crucial to understand its inherent complexities. Real-world applications often necessitate careful consideration in architecture selection, hyperparameter tuning, data preparation, and addressing potential challenges. Although the developed model offers insights into RNN's potential, it's more of a starting point rather than a definitive solution.

## Future Directions

1. Integrate additional features such as trading volume, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis from news articles.
2. Experiment with diverse architectures, including LSTM and GRU.
3. Investigate ensemble methods to enhance prediction robustness.
