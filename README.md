### Repo detailing some of my favorite personal projects, to supplement my own research and interests.

### Brief Project Overview

1. **LearnedSHAP**: This project details a novel Shapley-value collection methodology, LearnedSHAP, **proposed by myself.** Importantly, LearnedSHAP treats Shapley values as learnable parameters, with additional global-contextual perspectives via pairwise relationships between patches.

2. **PenaltyProphet**: Built my own dataset in order to predict where penalty kickers direct ball and where goalies dive to save the penalty kick. Pretrained on ImageNet on a DenseNet121 model, achieving **98%+ prediction accuracy.**

3. **StockSoar RNN**: Trained a simple RNN in order to predict future stock prices. Achieved results within **10% accuracy** after training on 3 years worth of historical data.

4. **SpotifyStreamPredict**: Utilized a feed-forward NN in order to predict the number of total Spotify streams for any song, achieving an overall error of **1.1%** on the testing datset
